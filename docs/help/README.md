## Understanding Rate Limits

Rate limits prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all users. Each platform has its own limits.

### Twitter Rate Limits

| Action | Limit | Time Window |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Tweets | 50 posts | 24 hours |
| API Requests | 300 requests | 15 minutes |

**What happens when you hit the limit:**
- New posts will fail with "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait for the time window to reset
- System automatically retries after the reset

**Tips to avoid rate limits:**
- Space out your posts throughout the day
- Don't schedule more than 50 posts per day
- Use the scheduling feature to distribute posts evenly

### LinkedIn Rate Limits

| Action | Limit | Time Window |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Posts | 100 posts | 24 hours |
| API Requests | 500 requests | 24 hours |

**What happens when you hit the limit:**
- Posts will fail with "Daily limit reached"
- Limits reset at midnight UTC
- Scheduled posts will retry automatically

**Tips to avoid rate limits:**
- LinkedIn is more generous, but don't spam
- Quality over quantity - focus on meaningful content
- Schedule posts during business hours for better engagement

### Instagram Rate Limits

**Note:** Instagram posting is coming soon.

2. Click **Disconnect** next to the affected platform
3. Click **Connect** and authorize again
4. Your scheduled posts will resume automatically

**How to fix:**
1. Go to **Settings > Connections**
2. Click **Connect** next to the platform
3. Complete the authorization flow
4. Try posting again

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Why this happens:**
- You've posted too many times in a short period
