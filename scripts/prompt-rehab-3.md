# Prompt Rehab #3 ‚Äî Context is your cheat code

Most people prompt like they're texting a coworker.
Short. Vague. Assuming the AI knows the backstory.

It doesn't.

‚ùå "Write a LinkedIn post about AI workflows."
‚ùå "Draft an email to my team."
‚ùå "Summarize this article."

You're sending the AI into a room blindfolded.
No wonder it gives you generic nonsense.

Here's the unlock: context isn't extra work, it's the whole game üëá

‚úÖ "You're a developer advocate writing for CTOs at B2B SaaS companies. Draft a 200-word LinkedIn post about n8n automation workflows. Tone: technical but approachable. Hook: start with a pain point about manual processes. End with a question to drive engagement."

Why it works:
‚Ä¢ "Developer advocate for CTOs" = audience + authority.
‚Ä¢ "200 words" = precise output constraint.
‚Ä¢ "Tone: technical but approachable" = voice guardrails.
‚Ä¢ "Hook / end with" = structure blueprint.
‚Ä¢ You've given it a job description, not just a task.

The more context you front-load, the less editing you do later.
Think of it like briefing a freelancer: if you skip the brief, you get 5 rounds of revisions.
