## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I need to use ALL 245 content pieces?**
A: No. The calendar provides templates. Use them as inspiration, customize based on what resonates with YOUR audience after Week 1-2 analytics.

**Q: What if I don't have time for 30-45 min/day?**
A: Reduce posting frequency. 2x/week LinkedIn + 1x/day Twitter is fine IF you engage consistently. Engagement matters more than volume.

**Q: Can I batch content instead of daily creation?**
A: Yes. See IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md "Content Batching" section. Write 4-7 posts on Sunday, schedule for the week.

**Q: What if my content gets flagged as AI?**
A: Use GPTZero to test. If >20% AI, apply humanization checklist (personal anecdotes, sentence variation, conversational markers). Retest.

**Q: Which platform should I prioritize?**
A: Both, but if time-constrained: LinkedIn for B2B SaaS audience (higher conversion), Twitter for developer community + reach.

**Q: When will I see results?**
A: Week 1-2: Feels slow (building momentum). Week 3-4: Algorithm recognizes you. Week 8-12: Compound effect kicks in. Be patient.

**Q: Can I use AI to help write content?**
A: Yes, but MUST humanize heavily. Use AI for outlines/drafts, then add: personal stories, specific details, emotions, conversational tone. Always test with GPTZero.
