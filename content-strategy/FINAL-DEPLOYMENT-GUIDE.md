## ⏰ Timeline: 10 Minutes Total

### Step 1: Run Supabase Migration (3 minutes)

**Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
👉 https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qdmmztwgfqvajhrnikho/sql/new

**Copy ALL of this SQL and click "Run"**:

```sql
-- Content Calendar System Migration
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS content_calendar (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  scheduled_date DATE NOT NULL,
  scheduled_time TIME,
  platform TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (platform IN ('linkedin', 'twitter', 'both')),
  content_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  topic_theme TEXT NOT NULL,
  hook TEXT NOT NULL,
  key_points JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  full_content TEXT,
  cta TEXT,
  hashtags TEXT[],
  seo_keywords TEXT[],
  estimated_engagement_score INTEGER CHECK (estimated_engagement_score BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
  ai_detection_risk TEXT CHECK (ai_detection_risk IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft' CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'scheduled', 'published', 'archived')),
  published_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  actual_engagement JSONB,
  content_pillar TEXT,
  week_number INTEGER,
  day_of_week INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE content_calendar ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own calendar" ON content_calendar FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own calendar items" ON content_calendar FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own calendar items" ON content_calendar FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own calendar items" ON content_calendar FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_content_calendar_user_date ON content_calendar(user_id, scheduled_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_content_calendar_status ON content_calendar(status, scheduled_date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_content_calendar_platform ON content_calendar(platform, scheduled_date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_content_calendar_week ON content_calendar(week_number, day_of_week);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_content_calendar_updated_at() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER content_calendar_updated_at BEFORE UPDATE ON content_calendar FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_content_calendar_updated_at();

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW content_calendar_summary AS
SELECT 
  user_id,
  DATE_TRUNC('week', scheduled_date) AS week_start,
  COUNT(*) AS total_posts,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'published') AS published_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE platform = 'linkedin') AS linkedin_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE platform = 'twitter') AS twitter_count,
  ROUND(AVG(estimated_engagement_score), 1) AS avg_engagement_score
FROM content_calendar
GROUP BY user_id, week_start
ORDER BY week_start DESC;
```

**Expected Result**: ✅ "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Check Vercel Deployment (2 minutes)

**Check deployment status**:
👉 https://vercel.com/chudi-nnorukams-projects/repurpose/deployments

**Wait for**:
- Status: "Ready" (green checkmark)
- Latest commit: "fix: Add csv-parse dependency" (940e6b0)

**If it's still building**: Wait 1-2 more minutes, then refresh.

**If deployment failed**:
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Check the error logs
3. Most likely: Missing environment variable (check Vercel settings)

---

### Step 3: Import 90-Day Calendar (2 minutes)

**Once Vercel shows "Ready"**:

1. Visit: https://repurpose-orpin.vercel.app/content-calendar
2. Log in (if needed)
3. You should see: "90-Day Content Calendar" page with import button
4. Click: **"Import 90-Day Calendar"** button
5. Wait for: "✅ Imported 245 calendar entries!"

**If you get 404**:
- Vercel deployment may still be propagating (wait 2 more minutes)
- Or try: https://repurpose-orpin.vercel.app/dashboard first to wake up the app

---

### Step 4: Verify Import (1 minute)

**You should see**:
- 245 content entries in dashboard
- Posts organized by date (Oct 21, 2025 → Jan 19, 2026)
- Mix of LinkedIn, Twitter, and "both" platforms
- Content types: Story Arc, Thread, Listicle, Carousel, etc.
- Engagement scores: 8-9/10 for most posts
- Status: "draft" for all entries

**Screenshot the dashboard** for confirmation!

---

### Step 5: Test Week 1 Content (2 minutes)

**Open Week 1 content**:
📄 `content-strategy/week1-content-FULLY-WRITTEN.md`

**Pick one post** (Monday LinkedIn Story Arc):

```
Hook: "6 months ago, I was manually reformatting the same LinkedIn post for Twitter 5 times a day. Today, Repurpose MVP does it in 10 seconds. Here's what I learned building it..."
```

**Copy it to a test platform** (Buffer, LinkedIn draft, or Twitter draft)

**Customize with YOUR numbers**:
- Replace "6 months ago" with actual timeline
- Replace "5 times a day" with your real pain point
- Add specific technical detail from your build

**Don't publish yet** - just verify you can copy-paste and it looks good!

## 📞 Need Help?

**If something fails**:

1. **Supabase migration error**:
   - Error: "Table already exists" → Safe to ignore
   - Error: "Permission denied" → Check you're logged in as owner
   - Error: "Syntax error" → Copy SQL again carefully

2. **Vercel deployment stuck**:
   - Check: Environment variables set (Supabase URL, keys)
   - Try: Manual redeploy from Vercel dashboard
   - Last resort: `vercel --prod` from terminal

3. **Import fails**:
   - Check: Browser console for error message
   - Verify: Logged in to app
   - Check: Supabase table exists

4. **404 on /content-calendar**:
   - Wait: 2-5 more minutes (Vercel can be slow)
   - Try: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Check: Deployment actually completed (not stuck)
