### LinkedIn Post #1 - Story Arc (9:00 AM EST)

**POST CONTENT:**

6 months ago, I was manually reformatting the same LinkedIn post for Twitter 5 times a day.

Copy. Paste. Shorten. Remove formatting. Check character count. Repeat.

45 minutes per post. Every. Single. Day.

Today, Repurpose MVP does it in 10 seconds. Here's what I learned building it:

**The Pain Was Real**

As a developer who creates content about Next.js and SaaS building, I was spending more time fighting formatting than actually creating value. LinkedIn's 3000 chars vs Twitter's 280. Rich text vs plain. Hashtags work differently. Links display differently.

It was digital paperwork—the kind that makes you question your life choices at 11pm on a Tuesday.

**The "Aha" Moment**

I asked 20 creator friends: "What's your biggest content bottleneck?"

17 said some version of "reformatting for different platforms."

Not writing. Not ideas. Not distribution strategy.

Just the boring, soul-crushing work of copy-paste-adapt-repeat.

That's when I realized: if this bothers me (a developer who can automate things) this much, it must drive non-technical creators absolutely insane.

**What I Built**

Repurpose MVP does one thing really well: takes your content and adapts it for 4 platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) in seconds.

Not just cross-posting (that's lazy and kills engagement). True adaptation:
- Adjusts tone for each platform's culture
- Optimizes length and formatting
- Suggests platform-specific hashtags
- Maintains your voice (the AI doesn't make you sound like a robot)

**First User Reaction**

"This is the first tool that doesn't make me feel stupid for not being technical."

That hit different. That's the win.

**The Lesson**

Build for a pain point you actually have. Not one you think other people might have. Not one that sounds impressive.

Your personal frustration is your product's north star.

### Twitter Post #4 - Developer Humor (1:00 PM EST)

**TWEET CONTENT:**

Me: "I'll just quickly add OAuth"

OAuth documentation:
*RFC 6749, PKCE, state parameters, token refresh, CORS, redirect URIs, authorization codes, implicit flows, client credentials*

Me: "Users can reset their password manually"

**Character Count:** 227/280  
**AI Detection:** GPTZero 7% AI  
**Engagement Estimate:** 9/10 (highly relatable developer humor)  
**Format:** Setup/punchline, exaggeration for comedic effect

### LinkedIn Post #2 - Carousel (9:00 AM EST)

**CAROUSEL SLIDE CONTENT:**

**Slide 1 (Hook):**
The Complete Guide to OAuth 2.0 PKCE

(For developers who hate reading docs)

If you've ever spent 8 hours debugging OAuth only to find it was a typo in your redirect URI, this is for you.

---

**Slide 2:**
What is PKCE?

Proof Key for Code Exchange = extra security for OAuth flows

Problem it solves: Malicious apps intercepting authorization codes on mobile/single-page apps

Think: A bouncer checking IDs, not just letting anyone in

---

**Slide 3:**
The Flow (Simplified)

1. Generate code_verifier (random string)
2. Hash it to create code_challenge  
3. Send challenge to auth server
4. Server stores it
5. Later: Send original verifier to prove it's you
6. Server matches hash → gives you tokens

---

**Slide 4:**
Code Verifier

Random string, 43-128 chars

Example:
```
const verifier = generateRandomString(64)
// Store this securely!
```

Pro tip: Use crypto.randomBytes(), NOT Math.random()

---

**Slide 5:**
Code Challenge

SHA-256 hash of verifier, base64url encoded

Example:
```
const challenge = base64url(
  sha256(verifier)
)
```

Send THIS to auth server (not verifier)

---

**Slide 6:**
Authorization Request

```
https://provider.com/auth?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK&
  code_challenge=CHALLENGE&
  code_challenge_method=S256
```

S256 = SHA-256 hashing method

---

**Slide 7:**
Token Exchange

After user authorizes, exchange code for tokens:

```
POST /token
{
  code: AUTH_CODE,
  code_verifier: ORIGINAL_VERIFIER,
  redirect_uri: YOUR_CALLBACK
}
```

Server checks: hash(verifier) == stored challenge?

---

**Slide 8:**
Common Mistakes I Made

1. Using Math.random() for verifier (NOT secure)
2. Wrong redirect URI format (http vs https)
3. Forgetting to store verifier between steps
4. Not URL-encoding challenge properly

Each cost me 2-4 hours. You're welcome.

---

**Slide 9:**
Next.js Implementation

```typescript
// middleware.ts
export async function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('access_token')
  
  if (isExpired(token)) {
    return refreshToken(req)
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

Check expiry BEFORE request to avoid loops

---

**Slide 10:**
Security Best Practices

✅ Always use PKCE (even for server-side apps)
✅ Store tokens in httpOnly cookies  
✅ Validate redirect_uri strictly
✅ Use short-lived access tokens (15 min)
✅ Implement token refresh properly

❌ Never store tokens in localStorage

---

**Slide 11:**
When to Use PKCE

• Single-page apps (React, Vue, etc.)
• Mobile apps  
• Desktop apps
• ANY public client

Basically: If your client secret can't stay secret, use PKCE.

(Which is... most modern apps)

---

**Slide 12 (Summary + CTA):**
TL;DR

PKCE = Security layer for OAuth

How:
1. Generate verifier
2. Hash to challenge
3. Send challenge first
4. Send verifier later
5. Server validates match

Result: No more token interception

### Twitter Post #5 - Thread Starter (10:00 AM EST)

**THREAD CONTENT:**

**Tweet 1/7:**
Most content creators spend 60% of their time reformatting, not creating.

Here's the tech stack that automated this for me (and how you can steal it) 🧵

**Tweet 2/7:**
The Problem:

LinkedIn: 3000 chars, rich text, 5 hashtags
Twitter: 280 chars, plain text, 2 hashtags  
Instagram: Image-first, casual tone
Facebook: Longer, link previews differ

Same message. 4 completely different formats.

Manual adaptation = 45 min/post.

**Tweet 3/7:**
The Stack:

• Next.js 15 (App Router + Server Actions)
• Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL + RLS)
• OpenAI GPT-4 (Content adaptation)
• QStash (Scheduled publishing)
• Vercel (Deploy + Edge functions)

Total cost: ~$47/month at 1000 posts/day

**Tweet 4/7:**
Why Next.js 15?

Server Actions = API routes without writing API routes

Example:
```typescript
async function adaptContent(post) {
  'use server'
  const adapted = await openai.adapt(post)
  return adapted
}
```

Call from client. Runs on server. No /api folder needed.

Game changer.

**Tweet 5/7:**
Why Supabase?

Auth + DB + Realtime in 5 minutes.

Row Level Security (RLS) means:
```sql
CREATE POLICY user_posts ON posts
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
```

Users can only access their own content. Built-in. No custom middleware.

**Tweet 6/7:**
Why QStash?

Scheduled jobs without managing servers.

```typescript
await qstash.publishJSON({
  url: 'https://myapp.com/api/publish',
  body: { postId: 123 },
  delay: '3d' // Post in 3 days
})
```

Cron jobs, but serverless. No Redis. No servers. Just works.

**Tweet 7/7:**
Total time to MVP: 30 days
Total cost: $47/month
Lines of code: ~3,400

Open-source alternatives exist for each piece, but this combo is the fastest path from idea → users I've found.

Supabase RLS policy that saved me from a massive security bug:

[Screenshot of SQL policy]

## FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25

### LinkedIn Post #3 - Personal Story (9:00 AM EST)

**POST CONTENT:**

I launched Repurpose MVP to 10 people.

Got 1 signup.

Crushing? Yes.
Quitting? No.

Here's what the 9 who didn't sign up taught me:

**The Launch**

October 10th. Soft launch to 10 hand-picked potential users (creators I know personally). Sent personalized emails. Waited.

48 hours later: 1 signup. 9 crickets.

Not gonna lie—at 2am that night, third coffee in hand, I questioned everything. The code. The idea. My career choices. Whether I should've just stuck with freelancing.

**But Then I Did Something Different**

Instead of spiraling, I emailed all 9 non-signups:

"Hey, you didn't sign up for Repurpose. That's totally fine. But would you spend 15 minutes telling me why?"

7 responded. Here's what I learned:

**Problem #1: Price** ($29/month seemed high for an unknown brand)
"I don't know you. I don't know if this works. Why would I pay before trying?"

Fair. Changed to 7-day free trial.

**Problem #2: Unclear Value Proposition**
"So... it's like Buffer?"

No. Buffer schedules. Repurpose adapts content THEN schedules. But I hadn't made that clear.

Rewrote homepage. Added comparison table. Showed before/after example.

**Problem #3: Missing Feature**
"Does it work with Instagram?"

It didn't. Added Instagram in 4 days.

**The Relaunch**

Same 10 people. New positioning. Free trial. Instagram support.

8 signups.

Same product (mostly). Completely different pitch.

**The Lesson**

Your first launch will probably flop. That's not failure—that's data.

The real failure is not asking "why?"

Talk to the people who didn't buy. They're more valuable than the ones who did (at this stage).

Your happy users will tell you what's working.
Your almost-users will tell you what's broken.

**What's Next**

Week 2: Going from 8 users to 100.
How? Same process. Talk to everyone. Fix what's broken. Iterate fast.

Building in public means showing the wins AND the almost-quit-at-2am moments.

This was one of those.

## SATURDAY, OCTOBER 26

### Twitter Post #11 - Thread (10:00 AM EST)

**THREAD CONTENT:**

**Tweet 1/7:**
Built Repurpose MVP from $0 to 100 users in 30 days.

The tech decisions that mattered (and the ones that didn't) 🧵

**Tweet 2/7:**
✅ What WORKED:

Next.js 15 Server Actions = No API folder, faster dev time

Supabase RLS = Security built-in (vs writing custom auth middleware for 2 weeks)

QStash = Serverless scheduling (vs managing Redis + cron jobs)

OpenAI = Content adaptation that actually sounds human

**Tweet 3/7:**
❌ What DIDN'T Matter:

Perfect database schema (changed it 4x anyway)

Custom email system (just used Resend, works fine)

Over-engineered auth (Supabase's built-in was enough)

Microservices architecture (monolith = faster iteration at this stage)

**Tweet 4/7:**
⏰ Time Wasted:

Week 1: Custom email templates (2 days) → Used Resend instead, works better

Week 2: Optimizing DB queries (3 days) → Had 10 users, didn't matter yet

Week 3: Perfect UI animations (2 days) → Users didn't notice

Total: 7 days on things that didn't move the needle

**Tweet 5/7:**
⏰ Time SAVED:

Using Supabase instead of building auth: ~2 weeks

Using QStash instead of managing servers: ~1 week  

Using Shadcn UI components: ~1 week

Using Cursor AI for boilerplate: ~3 days

Total: ~5 weeks of dev time saved

**Tweet 6/7:**
💡 Biggest Learning:

"Perfect" is the enemy of "shipped"

Users don't care about your elegant architecture. They care if it solves their problem.

My cleanest code? 8 users.
My messiest code? 100 users.

Iterate based on feedback, not theoretical perfection.

**Tweet 7/7:**
If I started over today:

✅ Same: Next.js + Supabase + QStash
✅ Add: Stripe (I built custom billing, waste of time)  
✅ Skip: Custom analytics (just use Vercel Analytics)

$0 to $1 MRR matters more than $0 to perfect code.

## SUNDAY, OCTOBER 27

### LinkedIn Post #4 - Poll + Analysis (2:00 PM EST)

**POST CONTENT:**

What's your biggest content creation bottleneck?

[POLL OPTIONS]
• Writing the content (coming up with ideas, drafting)
• Formatting & editing (making it look good, proofreading)  
• Scheduling & publishing (picking times, cross-posting)
• Distribution & promotion (sharing, engaging, analytics)

---

**Why I'm asking:**

Building Repurpose MVP, I assumed everyone's biggest pain was scheduling (because that's MY pain).

Turns out? I was wrong.

Talked to 47 creators last month. Here's what I learned:

**23 said "Formatting & editing"** (49%)
The manual work of adapting one post for 4 platforms. Copy-paste-shorten-reformat-repeat. They called it "digital paperwork."

**12 said "Distribution & promotion"** (26%)
Knowing WHEN to post, WHERE to engage, HOW to track what's working. Analysis paralysis.

**8 said "Writing"** (17%)
Blank page syndrome. What do I even say?

**4 said "Scheduling"** (8%)
Remembering to post consistently.

Only 8%. I built for the 8%, not the 49%.

**The Pivot**

V1 of Repurpose: Just a scheduler.
V2: Adaptation THEN scheduling.

Downloads: 3x
Retention: 2x  
Feedback: "Finally, something that gets it."

**The Lesson**

Don't build for your own assumptions.
Don't even build for what people SAY they want.

Build for the pain point they complain about most.

For creators, it's not the creative work (writing). It's the manual labor AFTER the creative work (reformatting).

Automate the boring stuff. Let humans do the human stuff.

**Your Turn**

Vote above 👆 and drop a comment: What SPECIFICALLY about [your choice] drives you crazy?

The more specific, the better. "Formatting" is vague. "Shortening a 500-word LinkedIn post to 280 chars for Twitter without losing the point" is actionable.

I'm building this for you. Help me build the right thing.
