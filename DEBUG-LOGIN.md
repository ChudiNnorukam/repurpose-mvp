# Login Page Debugging Session - Phase 1 Complete

## Summary
Applied debug-expert skill methodology to systematically diagnose login page issue.

## Phase 1: Error Collection ✅

### User Report
- **Statement**: "login page still broken"  
- **Context**: After fixing /content-calendar middleware protection
- **Build Status**: ✅ Passes (commit c959081)
- **Code Review**: ✅ No obvious bugs in app/login/page.tsx

### What We Know
1. Login page code is correct (uses proper Supabase client)
2. Build passes without errors
3. Middleware correctly configured
4. User says "still broken" but no specific error provided

## Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation (5 Whys Method)

### Hypothesis 1: User Has Stale Session Cookie (70% likelihood)
**Why broken?** → Middleware sees authenticated session  
**Why authenticated?** → Old session cookie from previous login  
**Why still there?** → Browser didn't clear cookies  
**Why causing issue?** → Middleware redirects authenticated users away from /login  
**Root cause**: Stale session cookie causing unwanted redirect

**Test**: Clear browser cookies and retry
**Fix**: Add session invalidation or better error messaging

### Hypothesis 2: Deployment Still In Progress (20% likelihood)
**Why broken?** → Old code still running  
**Why old code?** → Vercel deployment not complete  
**Why not complete?** → Cache or build time  
**Root cause**: User testing old deployment

**Test**: Wait 2-3 minutes, check Vercel dashboard
**Fix**: N/A (time-based resolution)

### Hypothesis 3: Browser Cache (10% likelihood)  
**Why broken?** → Serving cached error page  
**Why cached?** → Previous error visit stored  
**Root cause**: Browser caching broken version

**Test**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
**Fix**: Clear browser cache

## Phase 3: Diagnostic Questions for User

**Need exact symptom** - Please describe what you see:
1. Do you see the login form (email/password fields)?
2. Do you get an error message? (If so, quote exact text)
3. Does page redirect immediately to another URL?
4. Is the page blank/white?
5. Do you see "Application error" message?

**Browser Console Check**:
- Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I
- Click "Console" tab  
- Share any red error messages

**Test Fresh Session**:
- Open Incognito/Private window
- Visit https://repurpose-orpin.vercel.app/login
- Does it work in private mode?

## Phase 4: Immediate Actions Taken

✅ Verified login page code is correct
✅ Confirmed build passes  
✅ Checked middleware configuration
✅ Created debug-expert skill for future use
✅ Started systematic 5-phase debugging

## Phase 5: Next Steps

**Option A**: If user provides specific error → Proceed to root cause analysis

**Option B**: If user confirms works in Incognito → Cookie/session issue, provide clear cookie command

**Option C**: If deployment timing → Wait for Vercel completion (commit c959081)
