# FIXED: Generate Page - Accounts Loading Issue ✅

**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND WORKING
**Deployment**: https://repurpose-orpin.vercel.app/generate
**Commit**: `f692638` - Fixed non-existent column in query
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Problem Identified

The Generate page was showing "No accounts connected" even though accounts were properly connected in the database.

### Root Cause

**Error Code**: `42703`  
**Error Message**: `"column social_accounts.expires_at does not exist"`

The query was trying to SELECT a column `expires_at` that doesn't exist in the `social_accounts` table:

```typescript
// BROKEN CODE (line 72):
.select('id, platform, account_username, connected_at, expires_at')
//                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
//                                              This column doesn't exist!
```

### Actual Table Schema

The `social_accounts` table has these columns:
- `id` ✅
- `user_id` ✅
- `platform` ✅
- `access_token` ✅
- `refresh_token` ✅
- `account_username` ✅
- `account_id` ✅
- `connected_at` ✅
- ❌ **NO `expires_at` column**

## The Fix

**Changed line 72** from explicit column list to wildcard selector:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const { data: accounts, error } = await supabase
  .from('social_accounts')
  .select('id, platform, account_username, connected_at, expires_at')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .order('connected_at', { ascending: false})

// AFTER (FIXED):
const { data: accounts, error } = await supabase
  .from('social_accounts')
  .select('*')  // ✅ Select all columns that actually exist
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .order('connected_at', { ascending: false })
```

This matches the Connections page pattern which was already working correctly.

## Why It Was Hard to Find

1. **Misleading symptoms**: The error presented as "not connected" but was actually a SQL error
2. **Silent failures**: The 400 error wasn't logged with details initially
3. **Multiple false leads**: 
   - First thought it was RLS policy issue
   - Then thought it was JWT/session token issue
   - Then thought it was cookie propagation issue
   - Actually was just a simple column name error!

## Debugging Journey

1. ❌ **Attempt 1**: Tried API route with server-side auth
2. ❌ **Attempt 2**: Added `credentials: 'include'` for cookie passing
3. ❌ **Attempt 3**: Switched to direct Supabase query (same as Connections)
4. ❌ **Attempt 4**: Fixed useEffect dependencies to prevent race conditions
5. ✅ **Attempt 5**: Added enhanced error logging to see full error details
6. ✅ **SUCCESS**: Saw error code `42703` revealing non-existent column

## Expected Result

When you visit https://repurpose-orpin.vercel.app/generate you should now see:

```
✓ 2 platform(s) connected: twitter, linkedin
```

Instead of:

```
⚠️ No accounts connected.
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Visit: https://repurpose-orpin.vercel.app/generate
2. You should see the green success message showing your connected accounts
3. The Generate button should now work properly

## Files Changed

- `app/generate/page.tsx` (line 72)
  - Before: `.select('id, platform, account_username, connected_at, expires_at')`
  - After: `.select('*')`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Enhanced error logging is critical** - Without the detailed error logs, we wouldn't have found this
2. **Check schema before assuming auth issues** - Simple SQL errors can look like permission problems
3. **Always compare working vs broken patterns** - Connections page had the right pattern all along
4. **Error code `42703`** = Column does not exist (Postgres error)
