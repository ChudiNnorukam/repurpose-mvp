**Subject**: Quick question about your [CAMPAIGN] results

**Preview Text**: [NAME], I noticed you scored [SCORE]...

**Body**:

[NAME],

I was reviewing the [CAMPAIGN] results from last week and noticed you scored [SCORE]/100.

That puts you in the top [PERCENTILE]% â€” which tells me you're already doing a lot of things right.

But here's what caught my attention:

Your answer to "[QUALIFIER_QUESTION]" suggests [INSIGHT_FROM_QUALIFIER].

In my experience working with [SIMILAR_PERSONA], the biggest breakthrough usually comes from [SPECIFIC_RECOMMENDATION].

I'm curious â€” have you made any progress on [AREA] since taking the assessment?

If you'd like to explore what's possible for you over the next 90 days, I have 3 slots available this week for a complimentary strategy call.

No pressure, just a conversation about [OUTCOME].

Interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll send you the booking link.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. If the timing isn't right, no worries. Your results link is still active: [RESULTS_PAGE_LINK]
