INSTRUCTIONS:,,,,,,,
"Fill out this spreadsheet daily to track agent behavior",,,,,,,"Target metrics after 2-3 weeks:",
"- Delegation rate: 90% (tasks >10 lines use subagents)",,,,,,,
"- Research rate: 80% (unfamiliar patterns trigger researcher-expert)",,,,,,,
"- Citation rate: 95% (claims have sources with snippets)",,,,,,,
"- Error recovery: 85% (2nd failure triggers fallback)",,,,,,,

COLUMN GUIDE:,,,,,,,
"Date: YYYY-MM-DD format",,,,,,,"Track when task occurred",
"Task: Short description",,,,,,,"e.g., 'Add Twitter OAuth' or 'Fix calendar bug'",
"Agent: Which agent handled it",,,,,,,"feature-implementer, code-reviewer, ui-ux-expert, etc.",
"Delegated?: ✅ or ❌",,,,,,,"Did agent delegate to subagent if >10 lines?",
"Researched?: ✅ or ❌",,,,,,,"Did agent invoke researcher-expert when unfamiliar/security/standards?",
