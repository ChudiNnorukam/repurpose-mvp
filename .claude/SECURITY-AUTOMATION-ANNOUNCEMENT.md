# Security Automation Rollout - Team Announcement

**To**: Engineering Team, Product, Design  
**From**: Security Team  
**Subject**: 🔒 New Security Automation Going Live - Action Required  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What**: Automated security checks now run on every PR and nightly  
**When**: Starting this week (Oct 17, 2025)  
**Impact**: PRs may be blocked if HIGH/CRITICAL security issues detected  
**Action**: Review `.github/pull_request_template.md` checklist before submitting PRs

---

## What's Changing?

We're rolling out automated security validation to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production. This is a **good thing** - it protects our users and makes code review faster.

### Quick PR Checks (< 3 min)
Every PR will automatically run:
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scan (HIGH/CRITICAL only)
- ✅ Secret detection (API keys, tokens)
- ✅ Code security analysis (CodeQL)
- ✅ Accessibility check (landing page)
- ✅ Custom checks (SQL injection, XSS patterns)

### Full Nightly Scans (2 AM UTC)
More comprehensive checks run on main:
- Full dependency audit (all severities)
- Complete secret scan (entire git history)
- Extended security analysis
- Full site accessibility
- License compliance

---

## What Do I Need to Do?

### For Every PR:

**1. Use the PR template** (auto-populated when you create a PR)
   - Check off security items that apply
   - Skip sections not relevant to your change

**2. Review security checklist** (if you're touching sensitive code)
   - See `.claude/skills/_shared/security-checklist.md`
   - Auth changes require manual security review

**3. Fix any automated findings**
   - GitHub will comment on your PR with issues
   - Most are quick fixes (upgrade dependency, remove commented code)

### If You Change Auth/Security Files:

Files that trigger **manual review**:
- `middleware.ts`
- `lib/supabase*.ts`
- `lib/**/auth*.ts`
- `app/api/auth/**`

**Required actions**:
1. Tag `@security-team` in PR
2. Invoke `researcher-expert` skill for OAuth/crypto validation
3. Run end-to-end auth tests
4. Get security team approval before merging

## Common Scenarios & How to Handle

### ❌ Scenario 1: "PR blocked by dependency vulnerability"

**What you'll see**:
```
❌ dependency-audit-quick failed
Found 1 HIGH vulnerability in package xyz
```

**How to fix**:
```bash
# Check what's vulnerable
npm audit

# Upgrade if patch available
npm update xyz

# Or document exception if no patch
# (Add to .github/SECURITY_EXCEPTIONS.md with justification)
```

### ❌ Scenario 2: "Secret detected in commit"

**What you'll see**:
```
❌ secret-detection-quick failed
Potential OpenAI API key detected in file.ts
```

**How to fix**:
```bash
# 1. Remove the secret from code
# Use environment variable instead
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

# 2. Rotate the leaked secret (OpenAI dashboard)

# 3. Update .secrets.baseline if false positive
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

### ⚠️ Scenario 3: "Auth file changed - review required"

**What you'll see**:
```
⚠️ auth-file-review
Authentication files changed - manual security review required
```

**How to handle**:
1. Tag `@security-team` in PR description
2. Invoke researcher-expert:
   ```
   "Research PKCE flow for OAuth 2.0 (RFC 7636)"
   ```
3. Complete checklist in PR template
4. Wait for security team approval

### ✅ Scenario 4: "All checks passed"

**What you'll see**:
```
✅ All security checks passed
```

**What to do**: Nothing! Merge when ready (after code review).

---

## Week 1: Grace Period (Report-Only)

**Oct 17-24**: Checks run but won't block merges
- You'll see warnings, but PRs can still be merged
- Please fix issues you see (helps tune the system)
- Report false positives in #security channel

**Oct 25+**: Checks will block PRs with HIGH/CRITICAL issues
- MODERATE and below are advisory only
- You can request override for urgent PRs ([security-override] in commit message + approval)

---

## FAQ

**Q: Will this slow down my PRs?**  
A: No - quick checks run in < 3 min. Full scans run nightly.

**Q: What if I get a false positive?**  
A: Post in #security channel. We'll add to baseline/exceptions.

**Q: Can I run checks locally?**  
A: Yes!
```bash
# Quick check
npm audit --audit-level=high
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline

# Full (slow)
npm run build
npx playwright test
```

**Q: What if I need to merge something urgent?**  
A: Auth/secrets/HIGH vulns: Never bypass  
A: Other issues: Add `[security-override]` to commit + link approval issue

**Q: Where do I learn more?**  
A:
- `.claude/SECURITY-ONBOARDING.md` - Triage guide
- `.claude/DOMPURIFY-INTEGRATION.md` - XSS prevention
- `.claude/skills/_shared/security-checklist.md` - OWASP checklist
- #security channel - Questions
